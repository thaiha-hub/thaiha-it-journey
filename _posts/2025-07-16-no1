Tomorrow I will have an AZ900 exam, but i don't feel ready at all, even though i know it's just a fundemantal cert for cloud practitioners. But there is somehow too much information and too many things to remember with all services and their names. 
At the same time, I feel interested in testing and learning about github skills so I've got distracted so much. Wish my luck
