_**"It's so awesome that I've finally got my first Microsoft certificate!"**_
**Yahoo**
#AZ-900
## Why?
I've taken a course about cloud technology at my uni, and the teacher suggested that we can study for some certificates which can improve the chance of getting a job in the furture. So I've been thinking of taking AWS cloud practitioner cert. But then one of my classmate tipped me about getting the aZ-900 cert for free by joining the Microsoft Challenge. I was lucky enough to get it. 
I booked the test and studied hard for it.
## What to study?
There are several study sources available on the internet that one can pick and study. The offical materials are available on Microsoft Learn, which I started reading.
I found some contents from Microsoft Learn quite heavy on technical terms and complicated discriptions, and ofc boring with long texts, I then found some courses on youtube which summerise well the required content of the exam, plus they provided some mock test as well..
